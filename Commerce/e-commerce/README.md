# Building Application

---

The example application is an ```e-commerce``` site with the following features:

- Visitors can sign up, log in, and recover passwords.
- Visitors can search for products and view their details.
- Users can add products to their cart and checkout.
- An API enables external systems to search and retrieve product information.

You don’t need to care much about the details of the implementation. 
Instead, you’ll focus mainly on how a ```Flask Blueprint``` can be used to improve the application’s architecture.
